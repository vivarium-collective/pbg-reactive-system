"""MAPK bigraph signature — sorts and schema registration."""

# Bigraph signature for the MAPK model. Each name is a sort that
# tags a place-graph node via ``_type`` — sharing one namespace
# with the typesystem's schema registry, so these labels can later
# carry typed methods (serialization, value-update behaviour, etc.)
# without changing the matcher.
MAPK_SORTS = (
    'Cell', 'Compartment', 'NPC', 'MEK', 'ERK', 'pERK',
    'Cytoplasm', 'Nucleus', 'ERLumen')

# Backward-compat alias (older callers may still import this name).
MAPK_CONTROLS = MAPK_SORTS

# Minimal schema entries — each sort inherits the base ``node`` type,
# which is a permissive tree-shaped schema with no value semantics.
# Future work can replace these with richer schemas that attach typed
# methods (e.g. a ``MEK`` schema with a catalytic-rate update_method)
# without changing rule application — the matcher only reads the
# label, not the schema body.
